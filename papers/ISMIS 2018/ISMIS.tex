\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%More and more data generated every day come in the form of sequences.
%Examples...
%With such prevalence, many types of analyses are possible, including classification, clustering, and outlier detection.
%However, probably the most studied field of sequential data processing is sequential pattern mining.

Sequential patterns are an extension of frequent patterns (or frequent itemsets, known from association rule mining) to sequential data.
They find many applications in domains such as customer transaction analysis, web mining, software bug analysis, chemical and biological analysis~\cite{Aggarwal:2014}.
Just like with traditional frequent patterns, there are many versions of sequential patterns, depending on the structure of the sequences.
For instance, each event in a sequence can be either a single item or an itemset; the precedence of elements can be implied solely by their order or explicitly by time; time can be used to further narrow the problem by constraining time gaps between elements; each event in a sequence can be described by a symbol, a number, or a set of features, etc.~\cite{Dong:2009}.
On top of that, in scenarios such as classification, class information can be added to each element in each sequence.
This results in a setting where a dataset contains sequences of pairs $\langle\texttt{event}, \texttt{class}\rangle$.
In many real-world scenarios, however, such a setting is impossible to achieve, as the class information may be provided with a delay or even completely asynchronously from the analyzed events.
Consider a sequence of treatments prescribed to a given patient for a certain disease measured by some indicator (e.g., blood pressure).
After a series of events (e.g., pharmaceuticals, medical procedures, dietary regulations) the indicator may either improve, worsen, or stay unchanged.
However, this result does not necessarily coincide with any of the events nor need it be a result of one, all, or any of the events.
This scenario is universal when modeling people's behavior, opinion, or --- more generally speaking --- \textit{state}.
As illustrated by the examples above, this problem is no longer described by a single sequence of events (like in classical sequential pattern mining), but rather by two connected sequences --- one with the events and the other with classes.
To the best of our knowledge, processing of sequential data of such composition has not yet been considered and is the focus of this research.

The assumption underlying the described scenario is that the events in the sequences influence the outcomes registered by the classes.
A classical example of such an analysis performed on traditional data is the aforementioned clinical trial.
In order to properly model the outcomes of patients' treatments, the results need to be evaluated against a control group.
A method aiming specifically at this task is uplift modeling, as it's goal, as originally formulated, is to model the \textit{change} in peoples' behavior as a result of intentional activity~\cite{Radcliffe:1999}.

In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of state--changing sequential pattern mining.
Our method is designed to work in a setting where the information about states (classes) is provided separately from the underlying sequence of events.
Inspired by clinical trials, it relies on the notion of a control group and uses uplift modeling to factor this notion into the processing.
We experimentally evaluate our proposal using real-world data to showcase its superiority w.r.t. traditional sequential patterns in the described scenarios.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:related} outlines the research related to our proposal.
In Section~\ref{sec:main}, we formally define state--changing sequential patterns and show how to find them.
In Section~\ref{sec:experiments}, we experimentally evaluate our proposal and discuss the obtained results.
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}, we conclude the paper and draw lines of future research.

\section{State--changing sequential patterns}
\label{sec:main}

\subsection{Conceptual description}
To illustrate both, the problem we are tackling and our proposed solution, consider the following example.
Assume we have a history of marketing campaigns conducted by some company to it's clients.
A history of campaigns (in order of their occurrence) for a single client forms a single sequence of events.
Furthermore, assume that, from time to time, the company also monitored it's clients opinion about the company.
The opinion can be either negative, neutral, or positive (where negative $<$ neutral $<$ positive).
A history of a single client's opinions (in order of the time they were queried) forms a single sequence of the client's states.
Both of these sequences form a complete client's history, example of which is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:example}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/example}
	\caption{Example of an analyzed sequence, where $e_i$ represent events for a given object (e.g., marketing campaigns directed at a given client) and $s_i$ represent the object's states (e.g., negative, neutral, or positive opinion about the analyzed company).}
	\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

Given the above, the problem of state--changing sequential patterns can be conceptualized as follows.
Is it possible to find a subsequence of events (in this case, marketing campaigns) which will have a high probability of influencing the objects' state in a desired manner (in this case, changing the clients' opinion from a lower to a higher one).

Our proposed solution for the above--defined problem is a 3-step generic method, which can be described as follows.
In the first step, we mine the sequences of events for frequent sequential patterns, i.e., subsequences, which appear in the events dataset with a required minimal frequency.
In the second step, we map the states sequences to sequences of change.
Each state is mapped to a change indicator based on it's relation to the previous state.
A change from a lower to a higher state is encoded as ``$\uparrow$'' (\textit{up}); a change from a higher to a lower state is encoded as ``$\downarrow$'' (\textit{down}); and no change is encoded as ``$-$'' (\textit{none}).
The first state is mapped to ``$-$''.
In the third phase, we calculate the uplift measure of each sequential pattern for a given change indicator (e.g., ``$\uparrow$''), by contrasting the probability of this change appearing after a given pattern among the sequences with this pattern against the probability of this change appearing among the sequences without this pattern.
After this process, we have a list of sequential patterns with the information about their impact on a given change of state.
The whole process is summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:concept}.

\subsection{Formal description}
Preliminaries...
sequence,
sequence correspondence (events and states),
$s$ contains $p$: $p\in s$,
$d$ after $p$: $d^p$.

Given the above, the method proposed in this paper is defined as follows.
Given a set of event sequences $\mathcal{S}^e$, a set of corresponding state sequences $\mathcal{S}^s$, a desired direction of change \textit{d}, and a minimal support threshold \textit{minsup}, first, we are mining $\mathcal{S}^e$ for sequential patterns $\mathcal{P}=\left\{p:|\{s^e\in\mathcal{S}^e:p\subseteq s^e\}|\geq\textit{minsup}\right\}$.
Next, each sequence of states $s^s\in\mathcal{S}^s$ is mapped into a sequence of changes $s^c\in\mathcal{S}^c$:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
&s^c_1=-\\
&s^c_i=\begin{cases}
	\uparrow & s^e_{i-1}<s^e_i \\
	\downarrow & s^e_{i-1}>s^e_i \\
	- & otherwise
\end{cases}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $i=2..|s^e|$.
Finally, for each sequential pattern $p\in\mathcal{P}$ and a given change direction $d$, uplift is calculated according to the following formula:
\begin{equation*}
\text{uplift}(p)=P(d^p|\{s^e\in\mathcal{S}^e:p\subseteq s^e\})-P(d|\{s^e\in\mathcal{S}^e:p\not\subseteq s^e\}),
\end{equation*}
where $P(d^p|\{s^e\in\mathcal{S}^e:p\subseteq s^e\})$ denotes the probability of $d$ appearing after $p$ in sequences of events containing $p$, and $P(d|\{s^e\in\mathcal{S}^e:p\not\subseteq s^e\})$ denotes the probability of $d$ appearing in sequences of events without $p$.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}
\subsection{Experimental Setup}
This paper intends to evaluate the possibility of using state-changing sequential pattern mining to analyse real-world datasets, and on top of that, to assess the rightness of choice an uplift modelling to measure the actual influence of events on the change of state sequence values. Thus, we calculated several interestingness measures, such as support, confidence, coverage, prevalence, recall, lift, leverage, added value, Jaccard and relative risk. Then, we used them to assess the extent of sequential patterns occurrence on the positive shift ``$\uparrow$'' (\textit{up}) in state sequence values, and we compared them with an uplift measure.

Our solution was evaluated in a series of experiments using anonymised private data and publicly available datasets. We processed full datasets using different support values for each of them, using the Apriori algorithm to find sequential patterns. The experiments were prepared using software components implemented in R language. Almost all of the software components were implemented using R standard library. The exception is the component used for generation of two-element permutations of sequential candidate patterns, where we used "gtools" library. The experiments were conducted on the machine equipped with a dual-core I7-4770HQ @ 2,2 GHz processor and 16 GB of RAM.

\subsection{Datasets}
To prepare the experimental evaluation of the proposed method, we used three datasets containing sequential data. The Diabetes dataset is publicly available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes data about patients’ activity and blood sugar level measurements. A private marketing company provided the Events and Classes dataset. It contains data about marketing activity as well as the outcome of this activity. The FIFA dataset contains data about clickstream from the FIFA World Cup 98 webpage. It is publicly available on the website of SPMF – an open source data mining library.

To test the proposed solution, we amended two of the test datasets. The Diabetes dataset contains numeric attribute describing blood sugar level. We discretised this attribute into three classes, respectively describing blood sugar level as high, normal and low. Regarding the FIFA dataset, we generated the state sequence based on the original data. To each event, we assigned one of the three values describing the length of a subsequence, denoted as short, medium and long. A subsequence starts with the first element of the original sequence and finishes with the event occurrence.
